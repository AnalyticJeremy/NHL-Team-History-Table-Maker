# nhl-r

This is a collection of analyses that I've written for my favorite NHL team, the Nashville Predators.  It includes a library
of functions for interacting with the NHL API to get team and player data.  Everything should be parameteried well enough to
work with your favorite team or player.

### NHL Team History Table Maker
This is an R script that creates an HTML table showing the key players from each season for an NHL team.  For purposes of this project, "key players" are defined by simply by the amount of time they spend on the ice.

I've included [sample output](output/NashvillePredatorsHistory.html) for my favorite team, the Nashville Predators

### Other Ideas
There's always interesting analysis to be done with this data.  Here are some ideas I have:
- Most goals in a game for team
- Longest gaps a player has had in scoring goals for the same team
- Youngest and oldest people to play for (and score a goal for) a team
- Everyone who played with (and against) a particular player (with emphasis on the ones who are still active)
- Goalies that have won the most games in a particular arena
- Skaters that have scored the most goals in a particular arena
- All-Time Win Records at home vs away
- Overall record on Monday holiday games that have that weird early start time
- Players that have scored the most goals against a team
